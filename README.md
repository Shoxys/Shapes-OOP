## Introduction
In this first practical we will revise OOP design principles. For some students it will reinforce their OOP knowledge/application. For others, it will hopefully identify gaps in knowledge that require additional study and attention.
The task this week is the implementation of an application that models 2 dimensional shapes, performs operations of these shape objects, and displays specific properties about these shapes. To enable implementation of the required classes a UML Class Diagram has been provided. This UML Class diagram is shown in figure 1 below.
